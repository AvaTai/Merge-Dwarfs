Merge Dwarfs is a feature-rich, real-time mining simulation where you guide a squad of autonomous dwarves to uncover the secrets of a vast, hazardous map. 
The main goal is to find all the hidden chests on each level, which allows you to progress to a new, larger, and more dangerous map.

Your dwarves dig and explore on their own, but you control their path by placing directional arrows (left-click, click again to rotate) and building walls (right-click) to protect them from hazards like lava, floods, and cave-ins. 
When two dwarves of the same level merge, they form a single, faster dwarf. 
You must manage your growing team, protecting them from drowning in water and dying in lava, all while digging for gold to fund your operations.

As your dwarves explore, they'll find rewards: Hearts spawn new level 1 dwarves, Stars trigger a mass upgrade for your entire squad, and Presents grant individual dwarves permanent tools like a Pickaxe for faster digging, Goggles for revealing more fog, or a Mug of Ale to let them survive longer in water. 
The game is highly playable, featuring multiple levels, strategic power-ups, zooming via scroll wheel, a clickable minimap, pause functionality, sfx, and natural disasters.

The art, sfx, game design, bug testing, and some coding were done by me, with most of the code generated by Gemini. 
The sprites were originally AI-generated and later redrawn by hand to fit the 20x20 limit.
